title: Exercise - Dictionary Keys
level: Beginner
---

Given a pretty standard dictionary:

```
d = {
  'Jane': 33,
  'Elena': 17,
  'Margery': 28,
  'Savannah': 21
}
```

And a list of desired keys:

```
keys = ['Elena', 'Savannah']
```

How can you return a *filtered* version of `d`, without affecting what's stored in the original `d`?

What if the dictionary is more complex?

```
d = {
  'Jane': {
    'age': 33,
    'location': 'San Francisco'
  },
  'Elena': {
    'age': 17,
    'location': 'Petaluma'
  }
}

keys = ['age']
```

Try writing tests before working on the filter code itself. The specification of `keys` is up to you - can you think of edge cases where the format above is going to fail?
