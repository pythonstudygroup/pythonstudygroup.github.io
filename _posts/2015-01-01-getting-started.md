If you're brand new to Python, try one of these:

* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)
* [Thinkful: Programming Fundamentals](http://www.thinkful.com/learn/python-programming-fundamentals/#Setup)
* [LearnPython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/)
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)

It's worth discussing with people around you what your goals are. Is there something specific you want to build? Are you hoping to focus on data science, web apps, games, or something else?
