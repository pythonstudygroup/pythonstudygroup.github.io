Coursera has several Python-focused classes which we've heard good things about.

* [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1)
* [Learn to Program: The Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1)
* [Programming for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/course/pythonlearn)

For those who aren't complete beginners:

* [Crafting Quality Code](https://www.coursera.org/course/programming2)
* [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)
* [MIT 600.1x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-0)

Coursera classes work well with study groups since the regular schedule helps keep you on track (and self-accountable!), plus you can meet others taking the same class. It's sometimes good to hear that you weren't the only one bashing your head against a particular assignment!
